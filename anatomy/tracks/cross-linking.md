# Cross-linking

To allow cross-linking between concepts and exercises on Exercism, a special type of Markdown link can be used. Instead of display a link to the cross-linked item, we'll render a user-contextual widget, that shows that concept or exercise with its icon, user-specific status (unlocked, completed, etc), and which provides a tooltip.

### Link to: Concept

Link format: `[concept:<track-slug>/<concept-slug>]()`

Example:

```markdown
A ternary expression is an alternative to `if` statements.
